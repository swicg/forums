    A common concern with both users and implementors alike are deficiencies related to synchronization of conversations between different instances, as well as the inability to moderate conversations efficiently due to existing protocol expectations.

    Various approaches current exist in-the-wild for grouping related pieces of content together (a "conversational context"), either informally or otherwise. Some of these approaches are documented in a Fediverse Enhancement Proposal, while others are specific to their own implementation.

    This report lays out the current state of conversational contexts, lay the groundwork for a common approach for new implementors, and provide a set of recommendations for existing implementors.
