    A common concern with both users and implementors alike are deficiencies related to synchronization of conversations between different instances, as well as the inability to moderate conversations efficiently due to existing protocol expectations.

    Various approaches current exist in-the-wild for grouping related pieces of content together (a "conversational context"), either informally or otherwise. Some of these approaches are documented in a Fediverse Enhancement Proposal, while others are specific to their own implementation.

    This report lays out the current state of conversational contexts, lay the groundwork for a common approach for new implementors, and provide a set of recommendations for existing implementors.

    ## Introduction

    That a single object is part of a greater whole is not a new concept in communication methodologies. When individuals are speaking face-to-face, there is an ad hoc conversational context that allows for a mutual understanding of the topic at hand.

    The most prominent digital example of an ad hoc conversational context is email. There is no explicit declaration of context in any one email message, but a context can be constructed by grouping emails together by subject.

    Conversely, explicit conversational contexts became a useful structure to organize disparate pieces of content at the digital level. For example, chat messages are grouped in "rooms", forum posts are groups into "threads" or "topics", and so on. This structure persisted through many of the social media sites that rose to prominence, although the rise of microblogging (i.e. X, n√©e Twitter) signified a marked departure from explicit contexts back to an ad hoc context. While many of the deficiencies of an ad hoc context can be countered by centralization, this is not an option for a decentralized network like ActivityPub.

    This report provides an abridged history of conversational context resolution with respect to ActivityPub and its predecessors, outlines the current state, and lays out several recommendations for both new and existing implementations in order to coalesce toward a common definition for conversational context resolution.

    ## Nomenclature

    The _Forum and Threaded Discussions Task Force_, from which this report is derived, utilises a common set of vocabulary to represent identical concepts across a broad spectrum of implementations. These terms are as follows.

    * **object**: represents a single discrete unit of content.
        * a _post_, _status_, or _message_.
    * **context**: represents a grouping of objects under a common scope.
        * a _topic_, _thread_, or _conversation_.
    * **audience**: represents a grouping of contexts under a common scope.
        * a _category_, _community_, or _(sub)forum_.

    Generally, each successive term denotes a higher-level grouping of lower-level items. It is worth noting that not all implementations organize content using all three levels.

    Additional vocaulary items used in this report include:

    * **ad hoc context**:

    * **conversational context**:

    ## Legacy Implementations

    ### `as:source`

    * (https://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/schema/activity-schema.html#source)

    ### `as:scope`

    - [[activitystreams-vocabulary]]

    ### `ostatus:conversation`

    - mastodon
  </section>

  <section>
    ## State of Conversational Contexts

    ### `inReplyTo` and `replies` traversal

    - "bottom up"
  </section>

  <section>
    ## Goals

    ### Contextual backfill and synchronization

    - `replies` not broadly implemented

    ### Reply Limiting

    ### Moderation
  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    ## Fediverse Enhancement Proposals

    _todo: short one-paragraph summaries of related FEPs_

    ### FEP-1b12: Group federation

    ### FEP-171b: Conversation Containers

    ### FEP-400e: Publicly-appendable ActivityPub collections

    ### FEP-76ea: Conversation Threads

    ### FEP-7888: Demystifying the context property
  </section>

  <section>
    ## Recommendations

    ### Explicit conversational contexts

    ### Publicly-appendable Collections

    - already an integral part of all FEPs

    ### Multiple contexts

    - narrow to wide

    ### New implementors

    ### Existing implementors

    ### Concerns

    - overloading existing use of `context`
